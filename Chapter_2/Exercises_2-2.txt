2-2.1 :

f(n) = n^3/1000 - 100n^2 - 100n + 3
We only consider the leading term : n^3
O-notation : O(n^3)

2-2.2 :

@see SelectionSort.cpp

2-2.3 :

Linear search's complexity : O(n)
The average case = worst case = O(n) because we have to loop until we find the element.
The loop costs in any case a constant time to do.

2-2.4 :

We could check previously if the sequence is already treated and good. It would skip many useless steps and return directly the sequence
